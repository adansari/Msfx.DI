Your Contribution Matters

Dear Colleagues and Friends,

Hope you and your family is safe and in good health!

I am glad to inform you that I am open sourcing the .Net dependency injection framework, I know this isn't something new and plenty of them are already there. 

Though starting my open source journey with a conventional dependency injection framework which is a one of the very important aspect of the software design and it goes hand in hand with various Tech-Agile practices. Right now, it isn't yet released and is under preview.

Cordially inviting you to be part of this exiting journey and have your contribution in some way or other. 
You may:
- Download/Clone the code and samples and give it a try and share your feedback
- Help promoting this project
- Be a part of it and add new features, fix bugs, write documentations and develope extensions
- Become the advisor or mentor and contribute in creating the road-map, licencing, architecture and design

Here is the Github Repository URL: https://github.com/adansari/Msfx.DI

Code Samples: https://github.com/adansari/Msfx.DI/blob/master/README.md

Finally would like to thank you for all your help you extended in during the development.

Looking forward for your contribution!!
